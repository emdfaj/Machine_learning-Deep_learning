# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains some of my first machine learning and deep learning projects, including neural network models and self-made datasets. The projects here cover foundational concepts and applications in artificial intelligence, aimed at solving various machine learning problems.

### Overview
This repository showcases several deep learning models built from scratch using Python and popular machine learning libraries. It also contains custom-built datasets for training and testing the models.

The projects are ideal for:

- Understanding basic neural networks and deep learning architectures.
- Practicing with custom datasets.
- Exploring supervised learning techniques with real-world applications.

### Models Included
1. Basic Neural Networks:
    - Introduction to neural network architecture, activation functions, and backpropagation.
    - Example: Building a feed-forward neural network to classify images or tabular data.

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
    - CNN models for image classification tasks.
    - Example: A CNN built from scratch for recognizing handwritten digits.

3. Bayesian Neural Network (BNNs):
    - BNN models for image classification tasks.
    - BNN build for recognizing handwritten digits.
